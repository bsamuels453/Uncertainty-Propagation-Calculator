Uncertainty/Error Propagation Calculator
----------------------------
An easy to use uncertainty propagation calculator that uses the partial derivatives method to propagate the uncertainty of values in a specified equation. Accepts input in the form of an equation, variable values, and variable uncertanties. The output provides not only the uncertainty of the final value, but also the equations required to calculate the uncertainty including partial derivatives. Markup for said equations can displayed in LibreOffice Math format, Latex, and a normal format that you could enter into a calculator.

Info/Setup
----------------------------
This program isn't really done yet, but I'm not sure when I'm going to be picking it up again. Essentially, all the baseline features are working. I'm not 100% whether or not equation rendering will work on other machines because the pdflatex version I'm using is extremely finnicky. Equation input is locked at normal calculator style for now, and output format is locked to LibreMath. You can probably figure out LibreMath's formula syntax with a quick google search.

This program requires a wolfram alpha API key to generate partial derivatives. To get a key, go to http://products.wolframalpha.com/developers/ and sign up for a developer account to get a key. Plug this key into the calculator or paste it directly into apiKey.txt.

If you found this program useful, you might find my Least Squares Fit calculator useful as well. Lab reports have never been easier to write!
